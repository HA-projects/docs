# Proxmox

:::note
Proxmox is a virtualisation platform which enables a very simple evcc hosting.
If you plan to run evcc on a Linux Home server, Proxmox can be a flexible alternative,
which makes it possible to install other systems in addition to evcc. An evcc installation on [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) then behaves exactly
 the same way as an installation on a dedicated Linux server.

The following installation ha been tested with Ubuntu 24.4.
:::

## Installation

1. If not already present on your system, load a current Ubuntu template onto your server.
2. Create a Debian based LX container that is configured with minimal resources.
   (8G of disk and 512MB of RAM are plenty of ressources)

   See screenshot:

3. Install evcc as described in the instructions for Debian-based Linux systems [Debian, Ubuntu](./linux).

## Update

Update via the Debian, Ubuntu package management.
